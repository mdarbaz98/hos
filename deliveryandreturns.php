                            <p>
                                Our fulfillment process begins immediately after an order is received, so we are unable to accommodate cancellation requests. All confirmed orders will be subject to our standard return policy.

                                In the event that an item becomes unavailable, House of Sneakers reserves the right to cancel your order or items within your order at any time. We will provide a full refund, back to your original form of payment. You will be notified via email of any orders or items we cannot fulfill and have refunded.
                            </p>

                            <p>All returned items must adhere to our return policy for a refund to be processed:
                                - Items must be unworn, unused, unwashed and in the original condition received.
                                - Authenticity tags on footwear must be intact. If removed, the item will not comply with the returns policy and will not be refunded.
                                - Footwear must be returned in the original box provided, and packaged inside a protective shipping box.
                                - Return requests must be submitted within 14 days of the delivery date, and item(s) must be shipped back within 7 days of an approved request. Items that do not comply or are sent outside of this window are subject to refusal and may sent back to you.</p>

                                <p>Please allow up to 10-14 business days once your return has arrived back to us to inspect and authenticate the items(s) and process your refund. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method, excluding original shipping charges.</p>

                                    Due to the nature of our consignment marketplace, we are not able to offer exchanges. Since every item may have a different seller and level of availability, even identical items may vary in price.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you purchased an incorrect size, once received, you are welcome to submit a return request for a refund back to your original payment method. Please keep in mind that the returns process may take up to 14 business days before a refund is reflected back to your account.
